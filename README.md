# CandyMania
is a small project created by me, Jason, to hopefully become a better coder. It is a Minecraft server plugin that has multiple kinds of candy, that all have different effects. These can be used for PvP, amongst other things.

# Issues or Suggestions

# JasonHaxStuff
is me. I am a new coder, I started about 5 years ago with Codecademy, and worked my way up to being in an AP Computer Science class. This has truly been a great journey so far, and I hope to work with computers.
